# Bulk Email Sender
A simple program that sends an email (with attachments) to multiple recipients without showing all addresses the email was sent to.

I originally created this to reach out to multiple recruiters at once with my resume, but have repurposed the code to apply to more general use cases.

## Installation
```python
pip install yagmail
pip install keyring
```

## Usage
Edit the variables in "emailer.py" to suit your needs, then run it.
